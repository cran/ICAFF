Description: Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA)
         <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist_competitive_algorithm>
         is a computational method that is used to solve optimization
	 problems of different types and it is the mathematical model
	 and the computer simulation of human social evolution.  
         The package provides a minimum value for the cost function
	 and the best value for the optimization variables by
	 Imperialist Competitive Algorithm. 
         Users can easily define their own objective function
	 depending on the problem at hand. 
         This version has been successfully applied to solve
	 optimization problems, for continuous functions.
